# Project Title

The Mizzou Meme Maker was made by Mizzou students for Mizzou students to fill the need for dank Mizzou memes.

## Getting Started

For this project, we reserved the domain https://mizzoumememaker.com . The website gives an option to choose from a series of meme templates or an option to include your own picture. The website provides a box to enter a title, which will used as the file name if you choose to save it locally or the title of the Reddit post if you choose to post it to Reddit. The prompts for Top Text or Bottom Text will begin to put the text on the image. The buttons at the bottom give you the options for what to do with the photo.

### Prerequisites

This project utilizes Canvas so HTML5 is required to utilize the meme maker. 

### Installing

The Mizzou Meme Maker does not require any installation of software as the site runs through on a server.
