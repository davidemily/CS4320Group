# Project Title

The Mizzou Meme Maker was made by Mizzou students for Mizzou students to fill the need for dank Mizzou memes.

## Getting Started

For this project, we reserved the domain https://mizzoumememaker.com . The website gives an option to choose from a series of meme templates or an option to include your own picture. The website provides a box to enter a title, which will used as the file name if you choose to save it locally or the title of the Reddit post if you choose to post it to Reddit. The prompts for Top Text or Bottom Text will begin to put the text on the image. The buttons at the bottom give you the options for what to do with the photo.

### Prerequisites

This project utilizes Canvas so HTML5 is required to utilize the meme maker. 

### Installing

The Mizzou Meme Maker does not require any installation of software as the site runs through on a server.

## Built With

* [Javascript](http://www.javascript.com)
* [PHP](https://www.php.net)
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org)
* [Domain.com](https://www.domain.com)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)

## Why We Chose What We Did
#### Javascript
We chose Javascript due to the ease of the language and the information on it. Both IMGUR and Reddit have easy-to-read documentation on utilizing their API with Javascript. We were also able to find code on how to prompt the user to save locally using Javascript by using online resources. 

#### PHP
PHP was chosen for the website to search the attached database for meme templates. All of our members had experience with PHP through the Web Development and Database course, so it made sense to use a language we were familiar with.

#### MariaDB
MariaDB was used for the database because of the open source nature and it comes packaged with Fedora. 

#### Domain.com
The reason for using Domain.com as our domain provider is because the company sponsored Tiger Hacks so our members had free trial coupons. As the website is hosted from one of our member's servers, we did not use much of their hosting services.

#### Bootstrap
Bootstrap was used to style our website because of how easy it is to use and to find resources. 

#### HTML5
MizzouMemeMaker relies on HTML5's Canvas. We had originally planned to use the PHP GD library, but Canvas was much easier to work with.
