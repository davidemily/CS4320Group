# CS4320 Group Project Brainstorming

## Went with meme creating database and reddit bot to post memes to subreddit
  * Database to keep track of images made, web service for user to interact with, web service for reddit bot to interface with.
  * Select template meme
  * Write to image: Call name of picture, text you want in top, text you want in bottom.
  * Server to hold images created -- drop down with popular names, not allow same names, set tags for memes (?)
  
  ### Options we want
  * bot read reddit and post meme that coincided with print.
  * allow picture to be uploaded.
  * 
  
## What we need
 * AWS or personal server -- Linux LAMP + python bot, DB in mysql/mariadb. Leaning towards AWS
 * Domain name
 * Find out how to load text on images -- imagemagic & php(?), jquery plugin, python library for adding to images
  
# Ideas that didn't meet the cut

## Ideas with a lot of interest
  * Meme generator app - upload images, add text, share, download. Dynamically generated memes
  * Exercise app - this could be used IRL
  * Slack app for classes 
## Ideas with some interest
  * Tutoring app
  * Airport scheduling with minimum spanning trees for all airports in the world. Airport AIS trackers
## Backup ideas
  * File sharign app/Web UI uploads file, compresses it and then emails it to you - may be too simple (David is proud of this!!!!)
  * Website developer where you talk to it and it creates website for you
  * Facial recognition software for faceswap (microsoft has facial recognition software redily available)
  * Image technology take a picture of an album to find music like it - machine learning/copyright issues?
